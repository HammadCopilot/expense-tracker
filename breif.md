Here’s a solid **Project Brief** you can use as the foundation for your **PRD**, **designs**, and **test cases** — specifically crafted for a **POC (Proof of Concept)** of an **AI-powered Expense Tracker** that demonstrates the **power of AI-assisted SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**:

---

## **Project Brief: AI-Powered Expense Tracker (POC)**

### **1. Project Overview**

The **AI-Powered Expense Tracker** is a web-based application designed to help users manage, analyze, and optimize their personal or business expenses.
This Proof of Concept (POC) aims to demonstrate how integrating **AI across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** — from planning to deployment — can accelerate development, enhance accuracy, and improve the end-user experience.

The project will focus on showcasing:

* AI-assisted feature ideation and design.
* AI-driven automation in testing and documentation.
* AI integration within the app itself (e.g., expense categorization, anomaly detection, insights generation).

---

### **2. Objectives**

* **Primary Objective:** Demonstrate the potential of an AI-augmented SDLC pipeline through the development of a functional expense tracking web app.
* **Secondary Objectives:**

  * Showcase how AI tools can accelerate requirement gathering, UI/UX design, development, and QA.
  * Demonstrate how AI can enhance user experience through smart features (e.g., automatic categorization and spending insights).
  * Evaluate the feasibility and ROI of integrating AI into future production-grade development pipelines.

---

### **3. Key Features (POC Scope)**

1. **User Management**

   * Basic authentication (signup/login/logout).
   * Profile setup and dashboard access.

2. **Expense Tracking**

   * Add, edit, and delete expenses.
   * Categorize expenses (Food, Travel, Utilities, etc.).
   * Upload receipts (manual or via drag-and-drop).

3. **AI-Powered Features**

   * **Receipt Parsing (OCR):** Automatically extract data (amount, date, merchant) from uploaded receipts.
   * **Auto Categorization:** Use AI models to predict the category of an expense based on text or past user behavior.
   * **Spending Insights:** Generate summaries and insights (e.g., “You spent 25% more on dining this month”).
   * **Anomaly Detection:** Flag unusual transactions (e.g., sudden high-value spend).

4. **Data Visualization**

   * Simple charts to show monthly trends and category breakdowns.

5. **AI in SDLC (Meta Layer)**

   * AI-assisted documentation (PRD, test cases, and design suggestions).
   * AI-driven code generation and testing support (e.g., unit test generation).
   * AI-assisted bug triage and deployment optimization.

---

### **4. Technology Stack (Proposed)**

* **Frontend:** React (or Next.js)
* **Backend:** Node.js (Express) or Flask (Python)
* **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL
* **AI Components:**

  * OCR: Google Vision / Tesseract
  * Categorization: OpenAI / Hugging Face models
  * Insights: Custom LLM or rule-based engine
* **DevOps & CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Docker
* **Testing:** Jest / Mocha + AI-assisted test generation

---

### **5. Target Audience**

* Individuals and small business owners looking for a simple yet intelligent expense management tool.
* The client team, to experience the potential of AI-powered SDLC for rapid product prototyping.

---

### **6. Success Criteria**

* Functional demo showcasing the end-to-end flow of expense management.
* Demonstrable use of AI in at least **two major app features** and **three SDLC stages**.
* A clear, measurable reduction in manual effort or time due to AI-assisted workflows.

---

### **7. Deliverables**

1. **Product Requirement Document (PRD)**
2. **System Design & UI Mockups**
3. **AI Model Design & Integration Plan**
4. **Test Case Documentation (manual + AI-generated)**
5. **Working Prototype (Deployed)**
6. **Presentation Deck:** Demonstrating AI impact across SDLC stages.

### **8. Project Timeline (POC Duration: 3–4 Weeks)**

| Phase  | Duration                       | Key Output                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Week 1 | Requirement Gathering & Design | PRD, Wireframes, AI-assisted documentation |
| Week 2 | Development                    | Core expense tracking features             |
| Week 3 | AI Integration                 | OCR, auto-categorization, insights         |
| Week 4 | Testing & Demo                 | AI-assisted testing, presentation deck     |

---

### **9. Expected Outcome**

By the end of the POC, the client will see how an **AI-augmented SDLC** enables:

* Faster iteration cycles.
* Reduced human error in documentation and testing.
* Smarter, more intuitive product features.

The project will serve as a **case study** for scaling AI-driven SDLC practices to larger enterprise projects.
